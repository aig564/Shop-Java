# Shop-Java
This is a repository for my Shop Project made in Java.

This is some code for a Shop object in which things can be bought and sold in. 
The Shop is repesented by a collection of items in which it is created with. 
Items can then be removed from the collection with the buy function and added with the sell function. 
There are also buy and sell functions which take collections of items as well for multiple items.
